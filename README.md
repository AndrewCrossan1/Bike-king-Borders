# Bike-king-Borders

## Project Description
This project is for Developing Websites for Multiplatform use as part of my HND in Computing: Software Development

The project shows use of CRUD for creating, reading, updating and deleting different objects like products, special offers and users.

## The scenario

As part of the module we have been given a scenario to base our website from, and the scenario we have been given is Bike King Borders, a growing bike hiring
and servicing company based in the borders of Scotland.<br>

Currently as of 29/03/22 the website features the following:

- User Account login and creation
- Database connectivity (Obviously for the point above)
- Viewing of products by user
- Filtering of products using SQL

Soon I wish to implement the following features in the website

- Admin product CRUD
- Viewing of products to user
- The ability to add a product to basket and checkout
- A contact page where users can create tickets which can be viewed and replied to by administrators on an admin only page
- The ability to create special offers
- The abiltiy for users to apply special offers
- Users can change their password if forgotten
- The viewing and changing of account details
- A gallery containing images of trails and bikes which can be scrolled through by the user
- Admins having the abiltiy to remove/add users
- More content on each page
- Keybinds which keyboard only users can use to navigate the website
- Accessibility for impaired users (Text to speech and Magnification of text)

The deadline for this project is 2/6/22

## Testing 
Testing is carried out thoroughly after the development of each module (Usually by me using example accounts as a way of end user testing)
<br>
Product filtering is tested using different cases, some examples:
- Price Range: Â£0 - Â£410 |Type: Mountain | Colour: Black

## Technologies used
The project is majorly developed using PHP for scripting, where applicable I have went down the object-oriented route to enhance my OOP practising.

MySQLi is my choice for accessing databases.

The project is hosted on a docker container running PHP-Apache, MySQL and PHPMyAdmin (You can't use it unless you plan on stealing my laptop)

## Credits

The website has been developed by Andrew Crossan (Me!) :joy:

It serves as an example of my work for potential employers or educators and also an assignment for my HND.
