# Bike-king-Borders

## Project Description
This project is for Developing Websites for Multiplatform use as part of my HND in Computing: Software Development

The project shows use of CRUD for creating, reading, updating and deleting different objects like products, special offers and users.

## The scenario

As part of the module we have been given a scenario to base our website from, and the scenario we have been given is Bike King Borders, a growing bike hiring
and servicing company based in the borders of Scotland.<br>

Currently as of 29/03/22 the website features the following:

- User Account login and creation
- Database connectivity (Obviously for the point above)
- Viewing of products by user
- Filtering of products using SQL
- URL Rewriting for improved SEO
- Admin logging in and logging out
- JavaScript IP gathering and website Entry Time gathering.
- Admins can delete products
- Admins can add products
- Admins can read products, offers and sales.
- Admins can update products
- Products previews are displayed
- A contact page where users can create tickets which can be viewed and replied to by administrators on an admin only page
- The ability to add a product to basket and checkout
- The ability for users to apply special offers
- Live Search function using PHP, and AJAX.
- A gallery containing images of trails and bikes which can be scrolled through by the user
- More content on each page
- The ability to create special offers
- Admins having the ability to update user passwords
- Keybindings which keyboard-only users can use to navigate the website
- Specific product viewing page

Soon I wish to implement the following features in the website
- Offer viewing page


The deadline for this project is 2/6/22

## Testing 
Testing is carried out thoroughly after the development of each module (Usually by me using example accounts as a way of end user testing)
<br>
Product filtering is tested using different cases, some examples:

## Technologies used
The project is majorly developed using PHP for scripting, where applicable I have went down the object-oriented route to enhance my OOP practising.

MySQLi is my choice for accessing databases.

The project is hosted on a docker container running PHP-Apache, MySQL and PHPMyAdmin (You can't use it unless you plan on stealing my laptop)

Adobe XD is my choice of software for developing wireframes for the site.

The IDE I primarily use for this project is PHPStorm, it ticks all the boxes and gets the job done efficiently and in a robust manner.

## Wireframes
/admin/home/

## Evaluating as I progress
For the next major version of this site I plan to utilise:
- PHP.INI for auto starting sessions on each page
- Incorporating a settings.php file which includes media urls - Technically done but not to the extent I want
- A static folder for holding css, js and others
- No Code-Behind style of writing (PHP Pages will only require and include necessary files)
- More focus on the modelling of database tables (I neglected them halfway through)
- Using more advanced SQL (Multi-Table Insert for account creation)
- Creating functions of constantly used scripts, like redirecting if not logged in or not admin using JavaScript
- Less repetition of scripts where one function can be modified to accommodate all uses (Getting something from a database)
- Using composer packages: Twig, Google Captcha and Facebook authentication.
- Keeping all edit, delete, add and confirm actions in three files, doing it for each object is not good practice.
- Create forms.php, which contains forms with names, so add, delete, edit for a more dynamic webpage, keys in with above point.
- In general, better programming, this is probably the ugliest code I have genuinely ever written, V2 will be much better.
- Specific Product viewing
- Specific Account Viewing
- Specific Offer Viewing
- Asynchronous retrieval and updating of user data using $.get method.
- Product Reviewing system
- Bike King Borders Points Reward system

The website has been developed by Andrew Crossan (Me!) :joy:

It serves as an example of my work for potential employers or educators and also an assignment for my HND.
